# Backend with Node.js and Express

## Introduction
This module is an introduction to building a backend application with JavaScript using Node.js and Express. You will learn the basics of how a web server handles client requests. You will also search and use documentation resources to resolve issues that arise during development. Through practical exercises, you will learn to build your own REST API with Node.js, one of the most used technologies for structuring an API. You will also learn how to translate design sketches into working user interfaces.

## About Node.js
JavaScript is a programming language for clients and for servers. In order for JavaScript to be able to execute code quickly, various engines - "JavaScript engines" - have been developed. One such engine is V8, launched in 2008 as an open source project by Google - The Chromium Project.

In 2009, Node.js was launched as a platform-independent application for running code outside a browser - in a web server.

The ability to handle events also makes JavaScript useful as a server-based language. By listening to requests from a client, a server can send information back (response).

An example of that type of application is Node.js.
